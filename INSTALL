Pre-installation requirements

	- One of the supported UNIX platforms
	- MySQL client installed (+ includes/libraries)
	- Access to a local/remote MySQL 3.23.xx database

Step 1
------

  "./configure"

or append --with-mysql=<path> if MySQL is not installed in
/usr/local/mysql. You also have --with-mysqlinc, --with-mysqllib and
--with-mysqlbin directives if your MySQL includes, libraries and
binaries do not share the same parent directory.

You can specify the destination dir with --prefix. It defaults to
$HOME/oer+MySQL. You can also specify --enable-debug to switch on
debugging. (+ add debug symbols to the oer+MySQL binary, enlarges size
by 70%) Specify --disable-opt to de-activate
optimization. (--enable-debug does this automatically) Also, you can
specify --enable-profile if you want to enable profiling in the
oer+MySQL binary.

Step 2
------

  "make"

Step 3
------

  "make install"

The database and it's tables are created and filled with initial
data. Also, the oer+MySQL binary and a oer+MySQL sample configuration
is placed in the directory specified by --prefix. (defaults to
$HOME/oer+MySQL)

Step 4
------

You are done. Start oer+MySQL by invoking "./oer+MySQL" in the
installation directory. (most likely $HOME/oer+MySQL)

If you wish, you can remove the oer+MySQL-dist directory.
