1.0-42
------

- Rewrote the IRC client protocol parser due the PART issue
  discovered in -41 (this change could break just about
  anything!)
- Improved the channel mode, channel key and channel limit
  parsing in oer+MySQL (there is still room for improvement)
- Improved the socket family detection so that oer+MySQL
  should no longer attempt to connect to a IPv4 address from
  a IPv6 address and visa versa
  (Thanks must go to Renzo)
- Scheduled modes weren't adjusted when there was a nick
  change for a nick for which a scheduled mode existed, fixed
- Fixed yet another IPv4 <-> IPv6 interoperatibility issue
  (Thanks must go to Emperor)
- There was a missplaced freeaddrinfo() in network.c
  (Thanks must go to Lasse Lehtinen)
- Added Operating System information to CTCP VERSION if
  supported (shown only to bot users)
- Configure now checks for the availability of getaddrinfo()
- dbconnect didn't actually reconnect to the database since
  mysql_ping() doesn't automatically attempt a reconnection
  (Thanks must go to Sekto)
- dbconnect didn't check all MySQL connections, fixed
- oer+MySQL will now attempt to re-establish a broken MySQL
  connection in 10 minute intervals, not 30
- When the database connection has been disconnected oer+MySQL
  will no longer attempt to clean expired autheds until the
  database connection is available again
- I fixed a long lasting error in where oer+MySQL would
  sometimes get stuck in the server registration phase
- Added notice flood protection (how on earth have I
  overlooked this one)
- oer+MySQL would exit if it couldn't resolve the server
  hostname, fixed
- Changed gethostbyname() references to getaddrinfo()
- ECONNRESET in connect() is no longer seen as a fatal error
- Implemented reset autheds, requires global admin authorization
- Implemented reset masks, requires global admin authorization
  (Thanks must go to Refic)
- cleanautheds() would flood shared bots if more than one
  authed was cleaned, fixed
- Updated copyright strings to include year 2004

1.0-41
------

- The PART message has changed in ircu (the Undernet ircd)
  and it's derivatives (which include for example the ircd
  used in QuakeNet) -- Until I sort out whether this is
  indeed a bug or a known change in the newer ircu's here
  is a fix for it
  (Thanks must go to Emperor)
- Added uptime in seconds to CTCP VERSION
- Logoff didn't support multiple arguments, fixed
- Updated copyright strings to include 2003
- Added IPv6 support
  (Initial patch provided by Rakkis / MadQon, Thanks!)
- edit and del chankey returned nothing to the user, fixed
- dop, devoice, op and voice didn't check that the target
  nick was on channel before issuing the MODE, fixed

1.0-40
------

- A major oversight happened in -38 when I rewrote the
  authentication checks in parse.c, fixed
  (Thanks must go to Emperor)

1.0-39
------

- clearbans no longer removes permbans
  (Thanks must go to many out there, refic for reminding me)
- There was a typo in requestop, fixed (4 -> 5)
  (Thanks must go to Jase)
- Increased the maximum length of a single topic from 160
  to 250 characters, maximum number of topics is still 20
  (Thanks must go to Jase)
- There was a bug in the topic parser, fixed
  (Thanks must go to Jase)
- edit server was broken, fixed
  (Thanks must go to Renzo)
- jump didn't work as expected, fixed
- Fixed several commands which would eventuelly at some point
  corrupt their linked list structures:
	+ delnickbks()
	+ delwordbks()
	+ deladmin()
	+ deladminmask()
	+ deluser()
	+ delusermask()
	+ deltrusted()
	+ delservice()
	+ delchannel()
	+ deladverts()
	+ delserver()
	+ delchannelban()
	+ timed_del()
	+ mmode_del()
	+ userleft()
	+ cleanautheds()
	+ freepubmsguser()
	+ freenickchanges()
- initmmodes() left the list non null, fixed
- initmmodesfornick() left the list non null even if the
  list became empty cause of the operation, fixed
- Did some code clean up
- The change in -38 which makes oer+MySQL assume that a user
  which has @ also haves +v was broken, fixed
  (Thanks must go to Emperor)
- There were some issues with the detection of a broken
  database connection, fixed
- The manual reconnection to a database wasn't functioning
  properly, fixed
- You can now specify the full path of the config with -f
  (increased the length of the variable)
- validateflags() sometimes returned bogus values, fixed
- oer_doquery() no longer logs the MySQL execution times,
  the change was necessary due to a MySQL limitation (if
  output logging was switched on it would result to a
  "Commands out of sync" error message, the other way to
  fix this would be to have a second database connection
  just for output logging, IMO it's not worth it)
- Added global flag "S" to allow a shared oer+MySQL setup
  (in other words you will need to set global flag "S" to
  all your shared oer+MySQL beginning with this version if
  you require a shared setup, default is off)
- Topic delete now allows you to delete several topics
  at a time, for example "!td 2 5 7"
  (Thanks must go to refic)
- Removed the annoying "channel key is now.." and "deleted
  channel key from.." messages
  (Thanks must go to Renzo)
- Removed the custom isnumber() function (oer+MySQL wouldn't
  compile on FreeBSD)
  (Thanks must go to Trollo)
- Added SYNCGUIDE which you should read if you plan to
  implement a shared oer+MySQL setup
- Now admins and users can be fetched from a different
  database/MySQL installation (see SYNCGUIDE)
- tools/changeident.pl and tools/delident.pl were missing
  oer_ext table, fixed
- Added tools/delsyncdata.pl
- A friend (user flag "f") is now also allowed to use prohibited
  nicks, was the only thing a friend wasn't allowed to do
  (Thanks must go to Renzo)

1.0-38
------

- Added a timer to adverts just like with on join quotes,
  adverts on a busy channel were sent to each person that
  joined the channel, everytime (would cause "Target changing
  too fast" errors on heavy loaded bots and lead to adverts
  dissapearing)
- Added a chaninfo command (has also "s" chanflag support)
- sstats should now report correctly the IRC server name even
  if connecting to a Round Robin hostname
- Made a change in order for oer+MySQL to become more compatible
  with oz.org (hopefully they fix the way they use ERR_BADPING)
- oer+MySQL will from now on delete all not yet executed but
  scheduled MODEs for any nick that leaves a channel for any
  reason before the MODEs in question get executed
  (Thanks must go to Mauri Kinnunen)
- From now on when oer+MySQL detects a nick change oer+MySQL will
  re-target all pending MODEs for that nick to the new nick
  (Thanks must go to Mauri Kinnunen)
- There was a major oversight in how oer+MySQL sometimes parsed
  multi MODEs sent by the IRC server, fixed
  (Thanks must go to Renzo)
- Permbans weren't always synced after multi MODEs, fixed
- oer+MySQL refused to ban itself on a channel even if chanflag "b"
  wasn't set, fixed
  (Thanks must go to Mauri Kinnunen)
- oer+MySQL will now detect if Q leaves the network and will
  re-auth itself once Q re-joins the network
  (Thanks must go to Mauri Kinnunen)
- Implemented the first batch of type/value checking of user
  input values
  (Thanks must go to Mauri Kinnunen)
- Preliminary support for static linking (use --enable-static)
- oer+MySQL will now assume that users with +o also have +v and
  check for +v if a +o user should loose their +o (oer+MySQL wasn't
  seeing +v on users which had +o)
  (Thanks must go to Mauri Kinnunen)
- Rewrote most of the authentication checks in parse.c because
  many commands were simply broken, I hope I didn't break too
  much while doing so
  (Thanks Renzo)
- Removed some extra/non-necessary checks from parse.c
- Added a queuestats command (has also "s" chanflag support)
- From now on some basic network related error messages are
  always linked in (and shown) regardless if you specify
  --enable-debug or not
- Rewrote the MySQL connection checks implemented in -37,
  there was a huge error (oer+MySQL should now detect a
  disconnected remote database and recover in time)

1.0-37
------

- Removed the check for +m in flood protection (at least
  QuakeNet lets a +v user talk even if banned)
- Unban didn't unban +o users, fixed
- oer+MySQL allowed auto rejoin & part rejoin banvars to
  be 0 even if chanflag "r" was set, fixed
- Added del chanmode command
- Added user flag "n" which can be used to disallow someone
  the right to give oer+MySQL commands (for instance this can
  be used with bots to prevent missuse through those bots
  with a say command)
- Made messages more verbose in MySQL detection part of
  configure
- Added --enable-debianmysql to configure to allow
  configure automatically detect MySQL in Debian
- Fixed some issues with vhost
- Added del vhost command
- Fixed a major problem with mmodes and timeds (mmodes/timeds
  could just vanish without being executed, Thanks must go to
  Mauri Kinnunen)
- oer+MySQL will from now on strip mIRC colors and control
  characters when parsing a channel topic
- The "reset" command introduced in -36 broke del adverts,
  del nickbks and del wordbks (fixed)
- Permbans weren't removed from the channel when they were
  removed with the "reset" command, fixed
- Added a MySQL connect timeout (pingfreq/2)
- Since there isn't a proper query timeout in MySQL I wrapped
  oer_doquery (which is used in all database queries) to use
  dbping before invoking a database query to see if the
  database is still alive
- Signals were broken on newer Solaris versions (and have
  been for a long time), fixed
- Added support for signal SIGUSR1 which can be used to
  increase the level of debugging (0..max and max->0)
- If oer+MySQL couldn't join a channel because of IRC server
  error 439, oer+MySQL will now retry joining the channel in
  question after the amount of seconds specified by the IRC
  server have elapsed
- Did some tweaking to oer+MySQL version and copyright strings
- Increased the length of ext's message part, it can now be
  432 bytes in length assuming the IRC server will accept it

1.0-36
------

- Database fixes: execute scripts/fix_36.sql before
  running this version (adds the oer_ext table)
- It was possible to add a flag multiple times with one
  command, fixed (eg. edit chanflags oooooo)
- If a channel had force-topic set (chanflag "t") and Q
  was on channel with forcetopic, it would lead to a
  battle, fixed (Q is allowed if q friendly mode is set
  or q is set as a service)
- If you set any of the banvars to 0, the ban in question
  won't be set (if for example you don't want your users
  to be banned for swearing set the bad word banvar to 0)
- Did some autoconf/Makefile tweaking
- list handles will now go through global admins also
- Added delchannel.pl to tools directory
- clonechannel has always been broken because it didn't
  save the basic channel information to the database
  (channel name, mode, key, limit and channel flags)
- Added functionality for external information to be
  displayed through oer+MySQL, see the online help for
  command "ext" (ext has also "s" chanflag support)
- Fixed several bugs relating to timestamps and database
  based autheds (only relevant in shared oer+MySQL setups)
- When validating any of the flags oer+MySQL didn't clear
  the destination buffer which could lead to some problems
  on some platforms, fixed
- Added support for reconnecting to a mysql database
  (explicit dbclose & dbconnect and implicit reconnection)
- Updated BUGREPORTING (added a section for you lazy people)
- Added "reset" command (see Online Help)

1.0-35
------

- Database fixes: execute scripts/fix_35.sql before
  running this version (database based autheds)
- The ident column change (length 64 -> 20) introduced in -34
  wasn't included in initial.sql, fixed (did some further
  tweaking to initial.sql as well)
- Added support for chanmodes +c/+C (a QuakeNet extension)
- Updated the perl scripts in tools directory to reflect the
  recent database changes
- Added support for database based autheds, should make life
  easier for those who run shared oer+MySQL setups
- Forced logoff broke in -34, fixed
- If changing a dynamic user to a static one, oer+MySQL will
  from now on logoff the user automatically
- ff2mysql.pl removed from tools directory, use upgrade.pl
  from now on
- Updated HELP
- Manual logoff didn't work if channel had chanflag "x", fixed
- Added '+' and '!' to allowed channel prefixes (RFC 2811)

1.0-34
------

- Database fixes: execute scripts/fix_34.sql before
  running this version (renamed all oer+MySQL tables to
  oer_*, added ident columns to last & seen and decreased the
  ident column length from 64 to 20)
- Localized pattern matching, if you have some weird oer+MySQL
  behaviour (bankicking even if there is not a exact wordbk
  match etc), I suggest you test out this version
- If a channel has the "G" chanflag set and a opped non-admin
  user	triggers the flood protection, the user is now deopped
  first then banned (and kicked in case of repeat flood)
- To decrease the amount of network traffic in remote MySQL
  situations, the timestamps are from now on checked each 10
  seconds, not on each call of processenv()
- There was a typo in clonechannel() which would lead to
  passwords of dynamic users not being copied, fixed
- Added changeident.pl to the tools directory
- Made scripts in tools directory consistent (handle -> ident)
- Updated HELP
- wordbk's support now also exact matches (single words)
- edit password can no longer be sent to a channel
- Added a timeout to the registration phase (timeout is 10
  minutes after which oer+MySQL will connect to the next server)
- For obvious reasons " can no longer be used as a prefix
- The last command now encloses messages in "
- oer+MySQL no longer permits a user from channel A to use it's
  commands which require no channel parameter on channel B
  (the only problem with the old behaviour was that a user
  from channel A could flood channel B using oer+MySQL)
- Internal dynamic admin (global flag "d") wasn't deleted
  when disconnecting from a server, fixed
- Added user flag "s" (special user, just like a service but for
  a user), in a shared oer+MySQL environment you should set this
  flag to your oer+MySQL user(s) to avoid op & do-op wars (because
  of the polling change above, oer+MySQL doesn't always pick up
  immediatly the new users)
- Added a priority class for adverts, oer+MySQL should no longer
  cause excess flood with many (more than 30) small (less
  than 50 characters) adverts
- Rewrote the way wordbk's are handled, from now on words
  said by someone will be parsed word by word, not by sentence
  (IMO, it makes more sense this way)
- oer+MySQL didn't notice if it was kicked by a service, fixed
- Fixed yet another nick change bug
- I tested this version of oer+MySQL with muh 2.05d (a opensource
  IRC bouncer http://mind.riot.org/muh) and it seems to
  work, just remember to set the bouncer password as a server
  password
- In flood protection the +o/+v was given back before the ban
  was removed, fixed
- Changed "add channel" so that it takes now only one channel
  and optionally chanflags (this way you can add inactive
  channels and have oer+MySQL not join them)
- Changed bot handle to bot ident in pre_install.sh
- Basic support for a telnet proxy (specify the proxy string
  in "make install" or use "edit proxysetup" while oer+MySQL is
  running)
- Forced logons didn't work anymore with /msg, fixed
- There were also some other issues with autheds, fixed
- The channel modes weren't set on a channel created with
  clonechannel, fixed
- After a logoff no channel sync was done, fixed

1.0-33
------

- On startup oer+MySQL will no longer join all channels in
  parallel, it will from now on wait until it has actually
  joined the channel before joining another one (should cause
  less flood if there are more than 10 channels to join)
- Since -30 you could no longer set the global flag "o" to
  enable output logging, fixed
- Updated BUGREPORTING to correctly list the steps in enabling
  output logging
- If get'n'keep (global flag "g") nick is set, oer+MySQL will no
  longer attempt to get it's primary nick until it has joined all
  it's channels (in some rare circumstances oer+MySQL would get
  confused about it's nick)
- Added upgrade.pl to the tools directory, should make upgrading
  from oer to oer+MySQL even easier
- The logging of output messages is now enabled for initenv()
  to provide me with more information in case of bug reports
- Added command line option -a so that you can specify which
  ident is to be used in querying the database for admins, from
  this version on you will have to specify both -a <ident> and
  -u <ident> to get the old behaviour
- Added adminmove.pl and usermove.pl to the tools directory
  (use these scripts to move admins or users from one oer+MySQL
  ident to another)
- I made a typo in -32 that broke autheds for dynamic admins and
  channels without "x", fixed
- Specifying a reason to "add permban" works again
- Only global admins could force a logon, fixed
- Fixed requestop rule #1 (nicks 4 -> 5) and furthermore channels
  with more than 20 users are no longer automatically handled

1.0-32
------

- Added 5 scripts into the tools directory which should make
  it easier for you to move from oer to oer+MySQL, see the
  README in the tools directory (they might or might not do
  what you want)
- Changed CTCP replies to a lower priority, it should now be
  safer to set the global flag "f"
- Added chanflag "X" to disallow using of action and say by
  non admins
- If a dynamic admin or a user is deleted also autheds of that
  admin or user (handle) must be deleted, fixed
- There were several bugs relating to autheds and to the use
  of the "x" chanflag, should be fixed now (Thanks must go to
  Emperor| and QuakeNet's #Joensuu)
- Characters are now properly escaped before passed on to MySQL
  (there were some issues with at least the hyphen character)
- Changed the way list channels works, from now on channels
  that have a key, are secret or are hidden aren't shown if
  the command was sent to a channel (if the command is sent
  to oer+MySQL with /msg authorization checking will be done)
- list channels also now shows if oer+MySQL has +o on the channel
- Quit, massmessage and raw commands all dropped the first
  parameter if it was a valid IRC channel, fixed
- getserver() always scanned from top of the server list not
  from the current server if one was set, fixed
- requestop will now request op from O immediatly after joining
  a opless channel or right after the channel becomes opless
  (until now oer+MySQL would wait 300 seconds)
- A dynamic admin can no longer be changed into a static one or
  visa versa (use add admin)

1.0-31
------

- Cosmetic: increased the string buffer in parsemsg() to get
  rid of the annoying parse error ("..buffer too small..")
- Fixed some database issues relating to shared users
  (for example, clonechannel on the "slave" oer+MySQL would
  fail)
- Adding or deleting kick reasons with hyphens in them would
  fail, fixed
- Added support for QuakeNet's requestop feature, set chanflag
  "R" to activate it (see QuakeNet's guide for more information)
- oer+MySQL would falsely attempt to re-op users if chanflag
  "D" was set but oer wasn't opped itself, fixed
- if setlocale() failed carbage would be displayed, fixed
- lock would sometimes kick before +i was set, fixed
- lock would sometimes choose a nick that was already flagged
  for kicking, fixed (could be a problem on lagged servers)
- A inactive channel admin (user with "!" and "a" flags) is no
  longer allowed to change own flags
- Added a "cycle" command (useful to force oer+MySQL to leave
  & join channel and in doing so reseting some internal variables)
- locku didn't automatically unlock the channel after the last
  user to be kicked was kicked, fixed
- There was a bug in the get & keep nick feature which would
  result in oer+MySQL doing userhost queries for itself endlessly
  (the bug was quite hard to trigger though), fixed
- The oer+MySQL state was overwritten on startup by a bogus
  memset, fixed
- Added bstats command for reporting some bot statistics
- In a shared user database environment a sync is now forced
  after admins or users get reloaded

1.0-30
------

- list flags verbose was missing "n" flag, fixed
- Made some code optimizations
- Added a internal dynamic admin feature (global flag "d")
  which allows you to control oer+MySQL from oer+MySQL's
  userhost (meaning user@host, meaning ident + hostname)
- Added usercopy command which allows you to copy users
  within a channel or to another channel
- Added edit server (you can change settings of the current
  IRC server)
- edit options admin allowed non protected admins to make
  themselves/other admins protected, fixed
- oer+MySQL will now check that flags given to add, del or
  edit are valid
- global flags wasn't sorted if altered with edit flags
- Channel flag "x" had broken dynamic users/admins, fixed
- Command prefix and nick couldn't be the same, fixed
- Wrote support for channelbans (automatic detection,
  listing and clearing of them)
- There was a off by 1 error while choosing the kick reason
- Updated all (C) strings to contain year 2002
- When admins or users were reloaded in a >1 oer+MySQL setup
  (or if the timestamp was increased manually) it could lead
  to a situation where autheds would become invalid and would
  eventually make oer+MySQL crash, fixed
- clonechannel for a channel which had old type of logging
  resulted in erroneous behaviour, fixed
- Some cosmetic fixes relating to clearing of variables
- list channels showed +p channels and channel keys to
  everyone, fixed
- There was a bug in pre_install.sh which made it impossible
  to add additional oer+MySQL instances to a existing
  database, fixed (for sharing users for example)
- Rewrote oer+MySQL's channel flood protection routines

1.0-29
------

- oer+MySQL will now only fallback to making USERHOST
  queries, a WHO query is done on channel join
- made some code cleanup relating to processenv()
- oer+MySQL will now write a signoff message in case it
  detects a stoned server (if you see a "stoned server"
  signoff message, it probably means that the ping frequency
  in the server setting is too small, you need to increase it)
- Fixed chanflag "U" for last, seen, quote, and nstats
- nstats was broken for join count if new logging (global
  flag "n") introduced in -26 was set, fixed
- "add flags" and "del flags" were doing exactly the same
  thing as "edit flags", fixed
- Fixed several issues with chanmode, chankey and
  chanlimit (Thanks Renzo)
- There was a very hard to find bug in multiple mode
  processing that was introduced in -19, the bug would cause
  unbans etc. not to be scheduled, fixed (Thanks Renzo,
  Emperor| and Azo)
- list floodvars listed nickflood expire twice, fixed

1.0-28
------

- Database fixes: execute scripts/fix_28.sql before
  running this version
- Fixed add channel

1.0-27
------

- Fixed a potential crash when changing nicks, this bug was
  introduced in -25 (Thanks Renzo)
- Updated BUGREPORTING
- There was a lurking bug in the message parsing, fixed
  (oer+MySQL would obey to commands even if there wasn't a
  whitespace delimiting the prefix or nick name of oer and
  the command)
- add/del/edit chanflags was missing a channel sync, fixed
- Improved security for "list adverts" (when sent to a
  channel, oer+MySQL will check that there are no users that
  shouldn't see the advert, if there are the advert won't
  be shown)
- Added chanflag "c" to disallow ACTIONS on channel

1.0-26
------

- Database fixes: execute scripts/fix_26.sql before
  running this version
- There is now another way of doing last/seen logging
  (set global flag "n" to activate it, all channels
  will be logged into 2 tables so it will be less
  performant but will be more administrativeable)
- Fixed initial flooding of the console by processactions()
  in debug mode
- Decreased the default PRIVMSG/NOTICE barrier in
  processactions() by one second
- Changed oer+MySQL not to quote messages with "(c)"
- oer+MySQL now displays the current server in sstats
- Added a date command
- Added the "V" chanflag (auto voice admins on join)
- Removed the "(truncated)" from last command, as many
  characters as possible is displayed from now on
- Fixed several errors in "make install"
- Made on-join quoting return better quotes
- Added a UPGRADING text file describing what usually
  needs to be done when upgrading from version to version
- Fixed some Solaris/SunOS specific bugs, debug-mode
  should work again on those platforms
- oer+MySQL did not work with local channels, fixed (&unix)
- Logons that are expired are now correctly detected as
  soon as they expire
- If oer+MySQL is given a erroneus altnick and the primary
  nick is taken, oer+MySQL will use a random nick
- Added channel flag "x" to tell oer+MySQL not to timeout
  logons
- If channel has "O" or "V" flags, dynamic admins are now
  automatically opped or voiced on logon
- Added chanlimit (works just like chankey)

1.0-25
------

- Database fixes: execute scripts/fix_25.sql before
  running this version
- A response resulting from the deletion of a channel
  wasn't sent to the channel being deleted, fixed
- mysqlsafestr() simply failed if the destination buffer
  didn't have enough room, fixed (now it copies upto)
- There was a lurking bug in channel mode detection
- A response resulting from the deletion of a channel
  wasn't sent to the channel being deleted, fixed
- oer+MySQL had problems parsing lines with very long words
- One couldn't add a channel key if no channel modes had
  been set, fixed
- List flags now works the same way list chanflags does
- Implemented add & del flags (works just like chanflags)
- Added global flag "g" meaning get & keep nick (oer+MySQL
  will register itself on the server with a alternative or
  a random nick but will keep on trying to get it's primary
  nick as long as necessary, works also "on the fly")
- Added chanflag "t" to indicate you want a topic lock
  (all topic changes should go through oer+MySQL)
- On disconnect from the server not all of the internal
  parameters were being reset, fixed
- Added support for Q auth, see the Online Help for the
  syntax (NOTICE! your Q password will be stored in plain
  text, so extreme care should be taken)
- The channel mode wasn't being set on rejoin, fixed
- There was a longstanding bug where oer+MySQL wouldn't
  respond to some commands from a global admin if no
  channels had yet been defined
- "make install" allows now adding of dynamic global admins
- Adding & listing of both nickbk's and wordbk's work
  now in the same way (both have a optional reason)
- IRC REALNAME didn't allow >1 words, fixed
- Added some additional checks for NULLs
- Changed the way "lamers" are being picked on random ban,
  random ban & kick and lock
- Unified a bit the way nickbks and wordbks are being
  handled in oer and oer+MySQL (you might want to reset
  your nickbks and wordbks to get working kick reasons)
- Fixed some minor memory leaks
- Added channel flag "N" to indicate that oer should
  consider only bot users with "o" as channel operators
  (can be used together with "U" to make oer see channel
  operators without user records as normal users)
- Fixed oer from flooding itself with USERHOST queries on
  channels with hundreds of users
- Fixed list nicks to not cause excess flood on channels
  with hundreds of users
- Correct handling of the restricted connection indicator '^'
- Changed the way "lamers" are being picked on random ban,
  random ban & kick and lock
- Removed the notice that one shouldn't remove oer's permbans
- Fixed a memory leak in cleanautheds()
- Bogus chanmodes were sometimes set when oer was opped and
  there were unset chanmodes (or a chankey)
- Changed all occurances of "lamer(s)" to "normal(s)"
- Rewrote the server registration bits
- Topic separator is now a #define in oer-common.h
- Changed channelsync not to op/voice if channel doesn't
  have "o"/"v" flag set
- Added support for dynamic voice
- oer+MySQL no longer stops parsing oer.conf if it
  encountersa unparseable line
- Implemented nick flood protection (chanflag "k", also see
  the Online Help for the 2 new parameters to floodvars)
- Added chanflag "s" as in "serve all" (with this flag
  you can allow anyone on channel to use the following
  commands: help, info, uptime, sstats, last, quote,
  seen and nstats -- THINK BEFORE you set this flag, it
  will allow anyone to cause flood to oer and the channel)
- Added support for the remaining IRCNet user ID prefixes
- Rewrote the command scheduling logic (and due to this
  rewrital the wall command amongst others has been changed)
- Not all CTCP's sent to a channel were checked for flood
- Implemented nick flood protection (chanflag "k", also see
  the Online Help for the 2 new parameters to floodvars)
- Fixed the MAX CHANNEL detection (oer will now try to
  rejoin a channel it couldn't join because of the maximum
  channel limit)
- There was a bug when syncing permbans, fixed

1.0-24
------

- Added support for global admin passwords (works just
  like with channel users, just obmit the channel)
- NOTICE! Because of the above change you will have to
  go through your configuration before running oer+MySQL
  and see that no admin (in the admins table) has the
  "d" flag set, otherwise you will be unable to admin
  oer+MySQL because the admin has no password
- Fixed a subtle bug when processing multiple modes
- checkstoned will no longer be processed on startup
- Fixed add server so that it really requires just the
  hostname & port, other parameters are optional
- There was another lurking bug in the authorization
  checking, fixed
- Now also oer+MySQL has default kickreasons (they are
  inserted into database with "make install", you can
  also insert them manually from scripts/kickreasons.txt)

1.0-23
------

- Userhosts were being queried too fast on channel join
- Rewrote code where floating point math was used
- Added channel flag "M" and user flag "m" to prevent
  normal users from adding, removing or changing their
  hostmasks
- oer didn't check for the "l" chanflag when the lock
  command was issued by a non-admin user
- Fixed also other issues with the lock command

1.0-22
------

- Database fixes: execute scripts/fix_22.sql before
  running this version
- Topics were broken (fix_22.sql drops the PK from topics)
- Added failure notice to most topic commands
- delservice() was attempting to remove trusteds, fixed
- Trusted and services (hosts) can now have wildcards
- Fixed the op and deop commands
- Fixed the order of KICK and MODE in !bk and !rbk
- Fixed yet some MODE bugs (these all were introduced
  in -20 when I changed the size of NICKLEN)
- Fixed list channels to hide only +p & +s channels if
  the user requesting the list isn't at least op on the
  channel being listed
- Made the oer main loop process actions even after
  server I/O, should speed things up (not too much I hope)
- Changed NICKLEN from 15 to 20

1.0-21
------

- syncops() had a incorrect authorization check, fixed
- The order of KICK and MODE in ban & kick was also fixed
- When cycling a channel to gain ops the wait period
  between rejoins was decreased from 10 to 1 second
- Fixed the automatic synchronization that was called when
  oer was opped
- Fixed the service/server mode detection
- A misplaced return caused services not to be loaded
  on startup, fixed
- Added a HELP file describing what YOU can do FOR ME
- Fixed the "not a prototype" warnings for oer.c on Solaris

1.0-20
------

- Database fixes: execute scripts/fix_20.sql before
  running this version (I also fixed scripts/initial.sql)
- Until now only 2 characters of prefix was saved to
  database, fixed
- The server list is now sorted in a FIFO manner (until
  now it wasn't sorted at all)
- Rewrote bits of pre_install.sh and fixed logging of
  MySQL errors (questions default to 'N' now so that
  you can use "make install" to copy over the oer+MySQL
  binary and oer+MySQL.conf without making any changes
  to your data)
- In configure --with-mysql now defaults to /usr/local/mysql
- Changed NICKLEN, USERLEN, HOSTLEN and USERHOSTLEN to
  more realistic values (as reference I used Linux and
  the Undernet derived ircu, if you need to increase
  these to suit your needs, edit oer+MySQL-common.h)
- Updated last_yourchannel.sql and seen_yourchannel.sql
  in scripts directory (if you want performance you might
  consider at least the latter, change from dynamic to fixed
  length, involves manual steps in creating the table and
  transfering the table contents)
- updatelast() and updateseen() now first obtain a write
  lock for the last/seen tables before inserting a new
  record (this is a safety measure so you can for example
  work in the background with myisamchk)
- Decreased the wall delay from 5 to 2 seconds
- When chanflags L or S are set, added or deleted a more
  informative message is displayed
- Support for !del channel without parameter(s) was removed
- Added multiple parameter support for many commands,
  see the Online help (marked with []...)
- Listing autheds always listed all hostmasks for a authed
  handle, added support for start position
- showlast() and showseen() did no longer support common
  wildcards ? and *, fixed
- There were several authority check issues with the logon
  and logoff commands, fixed
- Failed database queries are now reported back to the user
  from the add/del/edit commands
- Fixed some database queries (floodvars, bantype, banvars,
  permbans)
- Changed the way permbans are added & displayed in oer+MySQL
  (I dropped support for multiple bans on add permban but
  added support for a ban reason, on list permbans also the
  nick of the person who set the ban and the time when the
  ban was set is displayed)

1.0-19
------

- Did some code cleanup based on profiling information
- Fixed clonechannel()
- Database correction: execute scripts/fix_19.sql before
  running this version (I also fixed scripts/initial.sql)
- Renamed last_oer.sql and seen_oer.sql to
  last_yourchannel.sql and to seen_yourchannel.sql in
  order to avoid confusion amongst new oer+MySQL users
- During "make install" in pre_install.sh a log file is
  now being created (pre_install.log), this change should
  make it easier to debug MySQL warnings/errors
- Added a BUGREPORTING file that contains instructions on
  how to send comprehensive bug reports
- Implemented add & del chanflags (you just specify the
  flags you want to set or remove, not the all of them)
- Changed del channel command so that it allows you to
  specify which channel to delete when sending the
  command to the channel, see Online help
- Updated INSTALL to reflect the requirement for MySQL
  3.23.xx (there is no real reason oer+MySQL can't be
  used with older MySQL versions, however the install
  script assumes MyISAM table/index types & extensions)
- Added devoice command
- Restored multiple modes
- Added support for services, this works just like
  the Q friendly mode except you can have several hosts
  (the global flag for services is "s")
- Rewrote processenv() and some related functions
- Added global flag "m" to make oer send messages
  instead of notices (not preferred)
- Added a TODO file (always first look at the TODO
  before suggesting a new feature)
- Removed the obsolete saveconf() since the settings in
  oer+MySQL.conf should be edited directly (they take
  effect when oer+MySQL is started)
- The default for oer+MySQL is now to have no debug
  messages, you will have to specify --enable-debug to
  configure if you want the messages (the size reduction
  of the optimized & striped binary vs. the binary with
  the debug messages & symbols is about 70%)
- Enabled the until now undocumented features "usersfrom"
  and "state" as command line parameters -u and -t
- Permbans weren't synced, fixed
- Did some additional code cleanup
- Topics weren't removed from the database when the
  channel was deleted, fixed
- Added a validity check when adding new channels
- Fixed a bug in authorization checking (for example
  if you had a "dfv" user with *@* and a bunch of
  "o" users with their respective masks, the *@* mask
  would get matched for the "o" users)
- If the "d" flag was removed from a user the password
  of that user wasn't removed from the database, fixed
- There was a memory leak when deleting a user with
  a password or removing the "d" flag from a user, fixed
- Changed the way list chanflags works: you will from
  now on have to specify "verbose" as a argument to
  list chanflags if you want the verbose listing
- Implemented server statistics (sstats)
- The stoned server checking was obviously broken and
  has always been (now only activity from server is
  counted as activity -- you may have to change your
  server ping frequencies to something more realistic,
  see /trace <nick> for the server class then see
  /stats y to see the respective Y: line, the ping
  frequency is the 2nd parameter for the Y:line)

1.0-18
------

- Database changes: execute scripts/fix_18.sql and
  scripts/add_keys.sql in mysql before running this
  version (scripts add consistency checks to tables)
- Did some code cleanup to avoid compiler warnings
- Added channel flag "D" to enable de-op protection of
  bot users with at least "o" flag
- Made linenoise to be a value from MIN..pingfreq (you
  will have to increase the value from 1 to something
  sensible like 10-30 if you don't want Excess Flood)
- Made error reporting in initenv() better
- Rewrote completely the scheduling of IRC commands to
  be priority then time based (since this is the most
  important part of oer, it will require a lot of testing
  by you the users to find out all the possible problems)
- Bumped up the amount of actions processed per loop from
  1 to 2 (if you get Excess Floods, set the variable
  OER_ACTIONS_PER_MAINLOOP in oer+MySQL-common.h to 1)
- If the configured bantype can't be set (because
  of trusted domains or conflicting hostmask with oer)
  oer will now also try other ban types
- Added a THANKS file that contains a list (not 100%
  accurate, sorry!) of people that have in some way
  contributed in the development and/or testing of oer+MySQL
- Added clonechannel command
- Made the combination of "d" and "f" user flags work

1.0-17
------

- Fixed a longstanding bug where oer would take user@host
  from the server as it's hostname instead of just the host
- oer will now also use the user id returned by the server
  instead of using the one in the config
- Added a bantype setting for channels, see online help
  (execute scripts/bantype.sql to create the table)
- Added a "all" and a "user@host" type to adverts
- vhost flag wasn't set on edit vhost, fixed
- Did some code cleanup
- oer incorrectly tried joining a channel waiting
  OER_AUTO_REJOIN_TIME seconds in between joins (the
  correct one is OER_DELAY_BETWEEN_REJOINS
- Fixed a memory leak in setpassword()
- Added --enable-profile to configure (enable this to get
  profiling information which you can study with prof/gprof)
- Decreased the default net join period from 30 to 15 seconds
- last & seen will now accept a second argument specifying
  how many entries to list (1..MAX)
- Reverted the sort order for last & seen

1.0-16
------

- Passwords for users with "d" flag weren't removed when
  the user was deleted. This would lead to oer+MySQL failing
  to start/reload users from database
- The inactivity flag is now also displayed in list users
- Fixed the time.h detection (especially Debian users
  suffered from this oversight)
- Channel admins can no longer add the "a" flag to other
  users making them channel admins
- List channels will now also list user count
- Added edit usermode, edit user and edit vhost
- All edit commands should now send a response
- Unified a bit the logic how responses are sent on add,
  edit, del and list commands

1.0-15
------

- Improved configure to allow alternative paths for
  the varios MySQL components (includes, libs and bins)
- Improved the installation scripts
- Fixed segmentation faults that were triggered on
  platforms lacking snprintf() if empty server
  passwords were passed to parseconf()
- Brought Copyright strings up to date
- Added support for ERR_UNAVAILRESOURCE (meaning if
  oer received ERR_UNAVAILRESOURCE from server because
  of netsplit or such, oer would fail)
- In addition to the set prefix oer will also now obey
  commands prefixed with it's active nick

1.0-14
------

- First public release
