If you want to help in the development and/or testing of oer+MySQL you
can do the following:

- Send me bug reports even if you are not 100% sure whether they are
  real bugs or just features

- Send me profiling information of oer+MySQL runs (configure with
  --enable-debug --enable-profile, let oer+MySQL run as long as
  possible then order the bot to quit and gather the profiling
  information with "gprof oer+MySQL gmon.out > prof" and send me prof

- Spread out the word, the wider oer+MySQL's userbase gets the higher
  the quality of the bot will eventually get

- Come and visit EQUNet (the IRC Network) at irc.equnet.org and perhaps
  stay, goto http://www.equnet.org for details

- I would appreciate if anyone who knows perl well would have a look
  at pisg's (http://pisg.sf.net) oer support (oer.pm) and finish it so
  that even the example sayings/etc. work

- If you are a native Italian or speak fluently italian, I would
  appriciate it a lot if you would ask the owner of the oer.org domain
  Matteo Salvestrini <salve@CONMET.IT> whether he intends to release
  the domain some day and at what terms

- If your oer+MySQL bot has been running for longer than 100 days,
  report your uptime to me! http://oer.equnet.org/uptime.php
