- Always read the attached CHANGLOG for any important changes between
  versions.

- If you are upgrading from any previous version of oer+MySQL you will
  have to run all needed MySQL fix_*.sql scripts in the scripts
  subdirectory.

- An example: If you are upgrading from version 1.0-22 to version
  1.0-26 you would run the following MySQL scripts: fix_25.sql and
  fix_26.sql, in that order.

- Invoke "make install" and answer "n" to all 3 questions.

- "make install" will simply place the new oer+MySQL binary to the
  destination directory. You could also copy the "oer+MySQL" over.

- You are done.
