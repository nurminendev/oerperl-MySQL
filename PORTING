This document is supposed to give you some guidelines in porting
oer+MySQL to another RDBMS such as Oracle, Postgress, Sybase, etc.

1) The database and it's objects are created with the pre_install.sh
script in the "make install" phase of the installation. You can use
mysqldump to get out the complete database for closer
analyzation. Alternatively, you can look at scripts/initial.sql and
the INSERT statements in pre_install.sh.

2) The database connection is created once oer+MySQL is started.
loadconf() takes care of filling the fields of mystate->mysqldb from
the config file which is read at startup. The database connection
itself is built in oer+MySQL.c after loadconf().

3) All database queries go through oer_doquery(). Grepping the source
for oer_doquery should reveal all places where the database interface
is being called.

4) The contents of the SQL queries passed to oer_doquery() are built
with MySQL in mind. It is very possible that the target RDBMS is
different from MySQL, hence further modifications might be necessary.

- Good luck and let me know when you come up with something!
